# 0x1E. C - Search Algorithms

## What is search Algorithms?
Search algorithms are a set of techniques used to efficiently search for a particular item or solution within a large set of data. In computer science, search algorithms are used to solve problems by exploring possible solutions, evaluating them, and then returning the best solution that meets the criteria.

There are many types of search algorithms, including:

- Linear Search: This algorithm sequentially checks each element in a list until it finds the target item.

- Binary Search: This algorithm works by dividing the search space in half at each step and discarding the half that cannot contain the target item until it finds the target item.

- Depth-First Search: This algorithm traverses the graph by exploring as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

- Breadth-First Search: This algorithm traverses the graph by exploring all the vertices at the current depth before moving on to the next level.

- A* Search: This algorithm is an informed search algorithm that combines the features of both Breadth-First and Depth-First search algorithms, it finds the best path between two points by evaluating potential paths based on a heuristic function.

Different search algorithms are appropriate for different types of problems and data structures. The choice of search algorithm depends on the specific problem to be solved and the characteristics of the data being searched.
