This readme covers all the major areas of C -Functions, nested and loops in C programming. the details below gives the full details of the project as well as the assigned tasks.

Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

General

What are nested loops and how to use them

What is a function and how do you use functions

What is the difference between a declaration and a definition of a function

What is a prototype

Scope of variables

What are the gcc flags -Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89

What are header files and how to to use them with #include

Requirements

General

Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs

All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89

All your files should end with a new line

A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory

Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl

You are not allowed to use global variables

No more than 5 functions per file

You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etc… is forbidden

You are allowed to use _putchar

You don’t have to push _putchar.c, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account

In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples

The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called main.h

Don’t forget to push your header file

Tasks:
0-putchar
2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when i can't fall asleep, i play what i call the alphabet game.
3. 10x alphabet
4. Islower
5. Isalpha
6. sign
7. There is no such thing as alphabet value in this world. You can only estimate what a thing is worth to you.
8. There is only 3 color, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important.
9. I'm federal agent Jack Bauer, and today is the longest day of my life.
10. Learn your time table
11. a + b
12. 98 Battery Street, the OG

Also is the advanced tasks to test us further in our understanding of the C - Function, nested and loops in C programming.
